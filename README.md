**Decentralized Food Vendor Marketplace with ERC20 Token**

This application simulates the traditional food vending operation. It keeps
Foods listed by the vendor(owner or seller) at a price tag, and someone(buyer) can buy the item by paying that price to the seller. It also comes with some checking functions to see if that food exists or is already purchased. Meanwhile the seller can remove the item from the marketplace provided that the item is not purchased to anyone yet.

An ERC20 Token is used as the pricing and payment method for this marketplace.
To be able to make any payment on the platform, a buyer is required to purchase tokens to enable him/her to pay for the food purchased. 

Also security analysis is conducted to discover errors, issues and security vulnerabilities in the code in order to suggest improvements and ways to fix them. 

Additionally, Unit Tests are written to make sure all the functionalities are working as expected and also help detect/protect against bugs in the future.
